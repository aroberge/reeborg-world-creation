# Adding your own robots and artefacts

> Vincent Maille and his two co-authors wrote a French book titled [Les robots](https://www.amazon.ca/Robots-Apprendre-Robotique-Par-lExemple/dp/2340013984/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1500382251&sr=8-1&keywords=les+robots+maille) which explain how to use Reeborg's World as well as Arduino and Lego Mindstorms robots. He suggested various enhancement to Reeborg's World and created an interesting world which I changed slightly to use as an example for this chapter.

With Reeborg's World, you can add your own images for robots and other objects, or reuse the existing images to create artefacts showing a different behaviour.
