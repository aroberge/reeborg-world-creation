From either the editor or the Python REPL, you can also get some _help_:

* To list all available Python functions, classes, etc., simply enter `help()`.
* To get help about a particular function, for example `move`, enter `help(move)`
* To get a complete, up-to-date version of every Python function available in the English version, enter

  ```python
    import reeborg_en
    help(reeborg_en)
  ```

  You can use `reeborg_fr` to get the corresponding French version. \[**Suggestion**: if you teach using a language other than English or French, I will gladly add a version in your own language ;-\)\] Note that this help system is specific to Python and does **not** include the available functions prefixed by `RUR.` With a few exceptions, if a function exists in Python \(e.g. `move()`\), there is one with the same name also available when using Javascript.
