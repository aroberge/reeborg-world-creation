## A brief word about Blockly

In addition to writing programs using a code editor, Reeborg's World makes it possible to use visual programming blocks to write programs.

This is made possible thanks to [Google's Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/).

In their [Best practices document](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/app-integration/best-practices), the creators of Blockly mention the importance of having a so-called _exit strategy_.

> Block-based programming is often a starting point for programming. In the context of teaching computer programming, it is a gateway drug that gets students addicted, before moving them on to harder things. How long this block-based programming period should last for students is hotly debated, but if your goal is to teach programming it should be temporary.

> Block-based programming environments used for teaching programming need to have a concrete plan for graduating their students. A solid exit strategy also goes a long way towards placating those who argue that block-based programming isn't "real programming".

One feature of Reeborg's World is the possibility for the student to see how a program constructed using blocks would be translated into Python or Javascript, thus providing such an _exit strategy_.
