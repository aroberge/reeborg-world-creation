# Support for non English-speaking students

Reeborg's World has been designed to support languages other than English. The User Interface currently supports English, French and Korean. The programming constructs are available in English and French.  This could "easily" be extended to other languages through users' contributions.

## A special keyboard

Some young students who are not used to writing using an ascii-based keyboard may find it difficult to write programs. To help them, Reeborg's World includes a special keyboard, which has three versions: one for traditional Python programming another for Javascript, and a third when using the Python REPL, each having multiple "tabs". Even if they have English-compatible keyboards, older students may find the special keyboard useful as a tool to quickly find out the exact spelling of a command or of an object.

> **\[info\] Suggested usage**
>
> * Use with devices which, while having a screen large enough to display Reeborg's World, require the use of an on-screen keyboard.
> * Use when some characters, like \[, \], {, }, are not easily accessible from your students' normal keyboard

Jurgis Pralgauskis originally suggested this addition to Reeborg's World for touch-based devices and proceeded to create a proof-of-concept version of his idea \([https://github.com/aroberge/reeborg/issues/169](https://github.com/aroberge/reeborg/issues/169)\).

Even if they have English-compatible keyboards, students may find the special keyboard useful as a tool to quickly find out the exact spelling of a command or of an object, as a quick alternative to the built-in `help()` command using Python.

This keyboard gives access to most basic commands but has not changed significantly since it was created, even though new basic instructions have been added. If you'd like to see some additions or other changes made to this keyboard, please [submit an issue.](https://github.com/aroberge/reeborg/issues)
