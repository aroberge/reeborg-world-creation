## Support for non English-speaking students

Reeborg's World has been designed to support languages other than English. The User Interface currently supports English, French and Korean. The programming constructs are available in English and French.  This could "easily" be extended to other languages through users' contributions.

### A special keyboard

Some young students who are not used to writing using an ascii-based keyboard may find it difficult to write programs. To help them, Reeborg's World includes a special keyboard, which has three versions: one for traditional Python programming another for Javascript, and a third when using the Python REPL, each having multiple "tabs". Even if they have English-compatible keyboards, older students may find the special keyboard useful as a tool to quickly find out the exact spelling of a command or of an object.
