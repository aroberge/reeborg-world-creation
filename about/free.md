## Reeborg's World is free

* Reeborg's World is free: you do not have to pay to use it.
  * I pay for the required hosting fees myself and currently have absolutely no plan to derive income from the site.
* Reeborg's World is open source; the main repository is public and can be found at [https://github.com/aroberge/reeborg](https://github.com/aroberge/reeborg).  I know that some teachers have installed a copy on their school servers for convenience and I have always try to offer support for those who want to do this.
  * **TODO:** add info about the special repository and update the information on that repository.
* All written material related to Reeborg's World, including this book, is freely available.
  * I might look into producing a paper version of this book to be sold at or near cost, but there will always be a free version available online.
* Reeborg's World does not require users to log in.  In fact, there is no login feature.  Unless users \(teachers or students\) contact me, I have no way to know who you are.

  * I do use [Clicky ](https://clicky.com/)to keep track of how many people are using the site. However I know that some adblockers will disable Clicky.
  * I do not embed any social media widgets, nor do I have any ads on the site. \[If the traffic on the site increases substantially, I might consider accepting support from a sponsor.\]
  * Reeborg's World does save the current state of a session in your browser's local storage, thus allowing to resume your work when you leave and come back to the site at a later time. I do not have access to this information.
  * There is a live collaboration feature available where two or more people can work together remotely; this makes use of Mozilla's server with [TogetherJS](https://togetherjs.com/). If you use this feature, Mozilla may know who you are - I do not.

* Reeborg's World is also designed with teachers in mind: while some basic **worlds **\(i.e., programming tasks\) are included by default, you can easily create and add your own. In fact, the motivation for writing this book was to give you the tools required to create interesting programming tasks.

  * It is my hope that you will contribute your worlds \(including images\) freely so that they can be shared with others.
