## Task Driven Learning

![](/assets/simple_task.gif)

Reeborg's World is designed for _**Task Driven Learning**_: students are given tasks that Reeborg has to complete, and they must write programs instructing Reeborg how to do so. Feedback is given automatically to students, without requiring a teacher to be present.

Tasks include having Reeborg move objects, build walls, or go to a particular location.  Objects in Reeborg's World are colourful; the places they be must moved to by Reeborg are usually indicated by having a picture of the object in shades of grey.

While most programming tasks will likely be relatively simple and aimed at beginners, such as "_Have Reeborg move these objects to some specific location_", there is no limit to how complex a given programming task can be.  As an example,  **very advanced students** can be given a randomly generated maze with one or more objects to be collected and asked to:

1. use the available methods to obtain a JSON description of the world;
2. transform this into some standard graph representation;
3. use search techniques \(breadth-first or depth first\) to find the shortest path required to complete the task;
4. accomplish the task following the path found, whose length can then be automatically compared with that of the true shortest path.[^2]

If you have some examples \(particularly tasks for Reeborg\) that you find useful for your students, I would appreciate if you could share them so as to improve Reeborg's World for everyone.

[^2]: I have not created such a similar task; interested teachers are certainly welcome to contribute such advanced programming tasks.
