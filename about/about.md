# About Reeborg's World

I am using the words _**Reeborg's World**_ to mean three different things. [Reeborg's World \(main site\)](http://reeborg.ca) is a website I designed to help people to learn programming. It includes a Python tutorial \(which is in constant need of updating\) available in English, French and Korean. However, **its main feature**, and the one primarily referred to in this document, is a single-app page which is usually what I mean when I write [Reeborg's World](http://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html). Finally, I can refer to Reeborg's _world_ \(lower case _w_\) as a single programming task.
