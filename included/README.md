# Out of the box

Reeborg's World includes a menu-driven world editor which makes it possible to create your own programming tasks, without having to write a single line of code yourself.  In this chapter I review this feature while showing you how to do the same by actually writing some lines of code.  This knowledge will enable you to create worlds much more complex \(and interesting!\) than what is possible using simply the menu-driven editor.
