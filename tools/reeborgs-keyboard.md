# Reeborg's keyboard

I have already mentioned Reeborg's keyboard in an earlier section; if you already have read the relevant section about it, you most likely can skip this section.

> **\[info\] Suggested usage**
>
> * Use with devices which, while having a screen large enough to display Reeborg's World, require the use of an on-screen keyboard.
> * Use when some characters, like \[, \], {, }, are not easily accessible from your students' normal keyboard

Jurgis Pralgauskis originally suggested this addition to Reeborg's World for touch-based devices and proceeded to create a proof-of-concept version of his idea \([https://github.com/aroberge/reeborg/issues/169](https://github.com/aroberge/reeborg/issues/169)\).

In addition to using with touch-based devices, some young students who are not used to writing using an ascii-based keyboard may find it difficult to write programs. To help them, Reeborg's World includes a special keyboard, which has three versions: one for traditional Python programming another for Javascript, and a third when using the Python REPL, each having multiple "tabs". Even if they have English-compatible keyboards, older students may find the special keyboard useful as a tool to quickly find out the exact spelling of a command or of an object, as a quick alternative to the built-in `help()` command using Python.

This keyboard gives access to most basic commands but has not changed significantly since it was created, even though new basic instructions have been added. If you'd like to see some additions or other changes made to this keyboard, please [submit an issue.](https://github.com/aroberge/reeborg/issues)
