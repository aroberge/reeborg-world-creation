Many problems can be solved by using an appropriate search algorithm. These algorithms are relatively advanced programming topics and are definitely **not** suitable for **beginning** students.  We discuss them in this chapter to illustrate how Reeborg's World can be used to teach advanced topics.

The content of this chapter will follow fairly closely the description and notation used on  [http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html](http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html). I have found that Amit Patel's [Red Blob Games](http://www.redblobgames.com/) site to be one of the clearest site when it comes to describing various algorithms used in games. His combination of clearly written code and interactive diagrams is truly outstanding. He has also helped with creating [more interactive examples](http://aimacode.github.io/aima-javascript/3-Solving-Problems-By-Searching/) used to illustrate [Artificial Intelligence: a Modern Approach](#), by Russell and Norvig.

It is my hope that by using Reeborg's World to run some code samples, modifying them at will, can provide a complementary approach to those mentioned above and contribute to a greater understanding by the students.
